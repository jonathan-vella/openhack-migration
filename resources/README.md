# Notes

Several PowerShell scripts are used to bootstrap the Host VM. They download and deploy the nested Hyper-V VMs that constitute the 'on-premises' environment.

Another script is used by students during the lab to enable the networking for the Azure Migrate appliance.

These scripts are copied to the openhackguides storage account (to the 'migration-open-hack-artifacts' container), and used from there.
